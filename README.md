First, I combined the training and test x and y and subject labels into one data frame.  I then used merge to attach the one- word activity labels to this data frame.  Next, I made the headings easier to read and attached them to the data frame.
I then extracted the variables that ended in mean or standard deviation.  There were 66 fields extracted.
